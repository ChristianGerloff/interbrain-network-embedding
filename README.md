# Demo of "Interacting brains revisited: A cross-brain network neuroscience perspective"

This repository is a demo for the interbrain networks and embedding method described in "Interacting brains revisited: A cross-brain network neuroscience perspective".

---


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview:

  The paper posits a comprehensive analytical framework for inference and prediction based on bipartite interbrain graphs and shows the general topological properties of interbrain networks. The proposed embedding in the paper provides a method to study interpersonal synchrony for inferential inquiries and prediction on individual level. This repository illustrates the generation of interbrain networks and the interbrain network embedding. The proposed framework comes with the following benefits:

*   interpretable: yields both global and region-specific insight (which regions seed  interpersonal neural synchrony)
*   accounts for uncertainty in channel localization
*   is applicable for both directed and undirected connectivity estimators

## Notebook

The repository contains an interactive notebook describing graph construction, graph reduction, and the embedding for ease of use.
